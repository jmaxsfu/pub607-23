# PUB 607 – 2023: Digital Production Fundamentals

Welcome to PUB 607, in which we will cover through Digital Production Fundamentals for both EBooks and Audiobooks, in just five short weeks! This course is based on John's *decades* of experimentation with digital production, which have been distilled here into a set of best practices. 

This course presents both *theory* and *practice* so that you may come to an understanding of *why* production should be done this way. The fundamental learning approach in PUB 607 is: working with a simplest-possible technological base, to be able to fool around and *play* with production techniques in order to become comfortable and confident that you can do these things.

## Assignments & Deliverables

You'll work collaboratively in teams of three to produce both an accessible EPUB ebook and at least part of an audiobook. The following are the critical milestones:

**Mar 9** – Install a text editor on your laptop (suggested: **Sublime Text**)

**Mar 14** – Install **Pandoc** on your laptop and peruse the User Manual.

**Mar 14**  'Acquire a manuscript' -- I recommend going to **Project Gutenberg** (pick the "Plain Text UTF-8" version of whatever book you choose). If you have a different idea of what you want to use, feel free, but please tell me.

**Mar 27** – Produce an *accessible ebook*, starting with plaintext, editing the text as markdown, then working iteratively with Pandoc, develop the stylesheet for the book and any images or other elements that you want. Finally, produce a EPUB3 version and test it! Your book will need a cover, cataloguing metadata, a brief report on accessibility testing, and a download page.

**March 28** – Install a Digital Audio Workstation (suggested: **Audacity**, but GarageBand or equivalent will also do)

**Apr 5** – Working with your edited text as script, produce and record an *audiobook* version of (at least 1 chapter) of your book. Your audiobook will need metadata, a cover, and a download page.

**Apr 6** – With an audience of your peers, random faculty, and possible a friendly guest or two, stand up and show off your team's ebook and audiobook, and tell a short story about your experience, challenges you faced, and/or things you're proud of: about 15–20 minutes, slides *not* required.
