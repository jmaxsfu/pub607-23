# Shaleeta's Compiled Links for 607

Hello, 607! Below you'll find a list of some of the helpful resources and background sources that John mentions. Also, many of you have it already, but you can contact me at shaleetaharper@gmail.com or sharrison@bcitsa.ca 



### Lecture One: Files and File Management

 - [Pair Programming](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/Pair-programming#:~:text=Pair%20programming%20is%20an%20Agile,code%20and%20test%20user%20stories.) as a method you could try while working on your manuscript
     - If you'd like to learn more about programming methods, [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) is another
 - [sync.com]() as an alternative to Dropbox
 - [Obsidian.md]() is an alternative note-taking app that uses Markdown. I can't remember *why* this was mentioned, but it looks great!
 - A book available at the SFU library is [Fumbling the Future: how Xerox invented, then ignored, the first personal computer](https://sfu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/usv8m3/01SFUL_ALMA21166450440003611) 


### Lecture Two: Text Production and Fundamentals 

- We discussed looking at [The History of the Alphabet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6yonf-SAXw). This is just one possible video, let me know if you find a better resource
- [Claude Shannon's Master Thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/11173) is one that John [and many others](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=622) mention as historically relevant for computers
- If you're still confused about [Base, Binary, and Hexadecimal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL-LhaaMTTE), take a peek at this video
- [Coach House Books](https://chbooks.com/About-us) is really cool and you should visit it
- Is there an International Equivalent to BiblioShare? I couldn't figure this out yet. I found [NPD Pubtrack and NPD Bookscan](https://www.npd.com/industry-expertise/books/) but these are more for consumer reports and data, not the sharing of booklists. Let us know if you find more information!
- [Four Shades of Gray: The Amazon Kindle Platform](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5298/Four-Shades-of-GrayThe-Amazon-Kindle-Platform)
- [Aaron Swartz was an interesting fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) 
- [BC Sans Font](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/bc-visual-identity/bc-sans) is a British Columbia Open Font based on Googles [Noto Font](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/preserving-endangered-languages-noto-fonts/), which was created to include as many languages as possible. This is a great font choice when including characters from other languages!
