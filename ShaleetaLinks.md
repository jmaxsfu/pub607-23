Hello, 607! Below you'll find a list of some of the helpful resources and background sources that John mentions in his lectures.

<br> 


### Lecture One: Files and File Management

*coming soon*

### Lecture Two: Text Production and Fundamentals 

- [The History of the Alphabet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6yonf-SAXw) 
  This is just one possible video, let us know if you find a better resource!
- [The Master thesis by Claude Shannon](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/11173) that John [and many others](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=622) mention as historical
- [A look at Base, Binary, and Hexadecimal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL-LhaaMTTE). This can be a big learning curve for us word-focused folks, so this is a quick look. 
- [Coach House Books](https://chbooks.com/About-us) is really cool and you should visit it. 
- Is there an International Equivalent to BiblioShare? I couldn't figure this out yet. I found [NPD Pubtrack and NPD Bookscan](https://www.npd.com/industry-expertise/books/) but these are more for consumer reports and data, not the sharing of booklists. Let us know if you find more information!
- [Four Shades of Gray: The Amazon Kindle Platform](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5298/Four-Shades-of-GrayThe-Amazon-Kindle-Platform)
- [Aaron Swartz was an interesting fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz)
