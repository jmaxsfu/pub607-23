## Project Structure

PUB607's purpose is to give you the space to explore, build, test, and learn. But as a structured course, it also needs allow for assessment -- or at least feedback. The way we will do this is through [Documentation]().

Every week, you will add to and edit the wiki. **Everything** should go here, everything from your running notes to your formal reports on what you're doing.

Each week -- as per the schedule above -- you are asked to report on your progress: on your research, your decision making, your prototyping, design, and building, your testing and your conclusions or recommendations. 

What John will be looking for in each of these weekly deliverables is a nicely edited and organized wiki page (or pages), easily found and navigated. 

Behind that nicely organized report can be a collection of notes, logs, links, and whatnot. You don't need to keep it all organized, but you should provide a well-edited front-door to it each week.

You should *always* look for opportunities to link what you're working on and learning with your classmates. That's the point of centralizing the documentation in one system.

## Who's Doing What?

If you are working on your own, you need to compose or compile your own documents. If you are working collaboratively, then it is your responsibility to sort out who is documenting what, and how it is going to be organized so that it is usable. By the first Friday, you need to clearly articulate who's doing what work: whether you're working independently, or if you are working in collaboration, who's doing what. This is part of the foundational Project Goals statement.
