In which you begin with a ‘manuscript’ from Project Gutenberg (or other rights-cleared source) by starting with complete clean plain text and using Pandoc to produce a good, lovely, and reasonably accessible ebook – and document the process.

### Pointers:

You will begin by **defining your project, its scope, and your top-level goals** for the three (er, two-and-a-half) weeks: what you want to do, what you hope to achieve, what's involved, and who's doing it. This is effectively a proposal for your project, although it's most written to yourself and for your own benefit. It is also, though, the way you will communicate what you are doing with John and with your classmates.

Defining your project and goals is the **first deliverable**, due (by notifying John) Friday pm of the first week.

Your second phase will be conducting research and defining specific objectives for the project. Here, you can begin by going broad -- thinking openly about all the things you find interesting and might want to do. But then, narrow this down by taking an inventory of what things you know and what things you don't -- as well as what resources you have, and what resources you need. Out of this you can narrow the top-level goals you defined at the beginning into some concrete objectives: what you plan to actually achieve -- and how you'll do it. 

Here are some specific things you might want to investigate to get started:
