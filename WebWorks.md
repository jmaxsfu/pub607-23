# How the Web Works

## The Internet and the Web

People use "internet" and "web" interchangeably, but they are actually two different things; one layered on top of the other.

The Internet dates to the late 1960s, when American defense department funding was interested to create an "inter-network" of various computing resources (that is, the room-sized computers of the day) into a shared resource. In 1969 (same year as the moon landing) they achieved this, interconnecting sites at UCLA, USCB, Stanford, Utah, MIT, and others via the [ARPAnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET). ARPAnet evolved into what we now know as the Internet. The current structure of the Internet -- that is, the specific software protocols that define addresses and message transfer -- date to around 1983.

One of the first major applications on the Internet was email. One of the first applications of email in the early 1970s was a mailing list, sf-lovers, the first online fan community.

## The WWW

In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee, a computer programmer working at the CERN particle facility in Geneva, came up with a system for cross-referencing documents across multiple computers. He didn't invent anything totally new; in fact, his real accomplishment is seeing how to combine three pre-existing ideas in a simple way:

1.  the Internet
2.  hypertext (associative or non-linear text)
3.  markup language

All of these things had long histories already, but nothing even approaching mainstream. Berners-Lee designed a *simplest-possible* system for embedding Internet-traversing hypertext links in electronic text files. Its simplicity was key to its explosive growth over the following decade.

Berners-Lee's invention comprised three simple things:

1.  HTML, a markup language for embedding links and simple formatting
2.  URL, a 'universal' address format
3.  HTTP, a call-and-response protocol between “web browsers” and “web servers”.

The Web was one of the first Internet applications to be about *content* rather than just connecting people or computers together. People outside of academic comp-sci or military circles quickly because interested. 

In 1993, the first "dial-up" Internet access became available to regular people and their PCs, connecting (slowly) to the global Internet via telephone lines. The result was exponential growth in the number of people online. The Web was the application that attracted most interest (even more than email), and so the Web itself experienced exponential growth too, through the 1990s.

By the end of the 1990s, there were tens of millions of people online, and millions of websites. In those days, most websites were hand-built collections of static HTML files and images. We now call this "Web 1.0"

"Web 2.0" came in the early 2000s, with database-driven websites that assembled content and user interface dynamically (like Wordpress), the rise of blogging, and early social media sites. Web publishing infrastructure became more of a back-office commodity, with the public focus being much more on content generation and community building online. In hindsight, this led to a move toward centralization of Internet infrastructure (and power), compared with the decentralized, DIY ethic of Web 1.0.
