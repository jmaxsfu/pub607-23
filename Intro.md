## Assignments

1. 'Acquire a manuscript' -- I recommend going to Project Gutenberg (pick the plaintext version of your book), but if you have a different idea of what you want to do, feel free.

2. Produce an *accessible ebook*, starting with **plaintext**, editing the text as **markdown**, then working iteratively with **Pandoc**, develop the **stylesheet** for the book and any images or other elements that you want. Finally, produce the **EPUB** and test it! Your book will need a **cover**, cataloguing **metadata**, and a **download page**.

3. Working with your edited text as script, produce and record an *audiobook* version of (at least 1 chapter) of your book. Your audiobook will need **metadata**, a **cover**, and a **download page**.
