# Assignments & Deliverables


## Deliverable 1: Acquire a manuscript

Due March 14 

Acquire a 'manuscript' to work with. We recommend going to Project Gutenberg (pick the "Plain Text UTF-8" version of whatever book you choose), but if you have a different idea of what you want to do, feel free, but please tell me. Be prepared to share the title and where you acquired it during class on March 14. 


## Deliverable 2: Download Page

Draft by March 21  
Complete by April 6
 
Thinking backwards, consider what happens when you have two files ready for your users. How will your reader access your eBook and Audiobook? Create a simple page in [Github](Github.md) so that users can access your files. This will help you become more comfortable with Markdown while considering the user experience of distributing the book.

## Deliverable 3: Produce an accessible ebook

Due March 27

Starting with plain text, editing the text as markdown, then working iteratively with Pandoc, develop the stylesheet for the book and locate and place any images or other elements that you want. Finally, produce an EPUB3 and test it! Lecture three, on eBooks, is where you’ll learn about creation and testing the book itself. Other than the book, you’ll need a cover, cataloguing metadata, and a brief report on the accessibility testing you put the book through.

**Cover:**   
Is it effective as a thumbnail? Does it match the interior font and style? Is it showing up on the EPUB as expected? 

**Cataloguing metadata:**   
This will be a plaintext file that’s packaged into your ePub with very basic information. See the files section for a sample format. 

**Report on Accessibility Testing:**   
Prepare this as if it’s an internal report (basically, be concise and clear, don’t make it pretty). This report should be about 1-2 pages and go over what testing you did, how your ebook did in these tests, and what changes you made as a result. 

We strongly recommend this be ready by March 27 so you can all be working on the audiobook. Once submitted, we’ll send you some feedback that you can consider (or not). 


## Deliverable 4: Produce an audiobook

Due April 5

Working with your edited text as script, produce and record an audiobook version of (at least 1 chapter) of your book. We have equipment available, but you will need to find an appropriate space to record. As with the ebook, your audiobook will need metadata, a cover, and that download page.


## Deliverable 5: Show and Tell

April 6 

With an audience of your peers, random faculty, and possible a friendly guest or two, stand up and show off your team's ebook and audiobook, and tell a short story about your experience, challenges you faced, and/or things you're proud of: about 15–20 minutes, slides not required. Spend more time on the how than the what. Participate by asking at least one question of another group.
