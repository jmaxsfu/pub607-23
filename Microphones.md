# About "Dynamic" and "Condenser" Microphones

A **dynamic mic** like the Shure SM58 is a supremely simple, low-tech thing. It actually uses no electricity -- because it *generates* electricity: the sound waves from your voice wiggle a little 'diaphragm' which moves a coil of wire past a magnet -- and voila, an electric signal.  Dynamic mics are simple, robust, long-lasting (see "mic drop" but DO NOT actually do this). But they require a close, direct sound source -- someone speaking directly into the microphone, or a drum, or an amplifier.


A **condenser mic** works differently: a small electric current flows through the mic, and the sound waves from your voice wiggle the "condenser," which affects the electric signal. Condenser mics are more sensistive at a distance, and therefore better for capturing audio from a farther and/or larger source (like a piano, or a choir) and more ambient sound from the room. You do not "eat" these mics... probably more like 6\"-12\" away.

The Zoom recorders have a pair of condenser mics on the top of them (for stereo recording). Your laptop has a condenser mic in it.

Because a condenser mic needs electricity, there has to be a source. Both the Zoom recorder and John's FastTrack Pro Audio Interface have the ability to turn on "Phantom power" -- which is a low-current, 48volt source that allows the mic to work. Or if you're using a built-in mic, don't worry about it, because it's already wired up.

# CAD GXL1200 Condenser Mic

John brought this one in. You can use it just like you do the Shure SM58, and see if you like the results. It's quite a bit more sensitive than an SM58, so it needs to be placed farther away if you're recording your voice -- a good trick is to mount it on a stand and point it at your forehead instead of your mouth, to avoid "Popping your Ps." (look it up!)

A condenser mic like this requires 48volts of "Phantom power" -- which is available on both the Zoom recorder and the FastTrack Pro Audio Interface... you just switch that on and it works.

# Shure SM58

The **SM58** is the classic "ice cream cone" style mic, as used by Aretha Franklin, among a few zillion other people over the years :-) The '58 is the gold standard for a "dynamic microphone" (you should google that too). They started making these in *1966* and they are still the standard.

A dynamic mic like this works by being quite close to the sound source (see "eat the mic" but don't actually do that; a couple or three inches away is better). Close miking results in that warm, intimate sound (like in *Witch Please*). Also, Aretha Franklin belting out *Respect*.

It occurs to me that an SM58, being a very up-close-and-personal microphone, is probably a terrific **germ vector**. Best option would be for these mics to be used by one person only. But you can clean them pretty easily -- you can simply unscrew the ball-shaped cage and wash it. Here's the manufacturer's instructions: <https://service.shure.com/s/article/how-should-i-clean-my-microphone?language=en_US>



# FastTrack Pro Audio Interface

John brought in this old (2012 or so?) USB interface. 

![FastTrack Pro Audio USB Interface](/fasttrack.jpg)

It does PART of what the Zoom H4n does -- it takes [XLR Cables]() or regular old 1/4" audio cords and converts that to digital signals which then go via USB to your computer. This is the fundamental little box that makes digital audio recording possible. In professional studios, they have very big fancy ones; this is a very simple, cheap one. It has two inputs.
