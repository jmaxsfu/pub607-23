## In groups of three:

1. Get a "manuscript" -- I recommend going to Project Gutenberg (pick the plaintext version of your book), but if you have a different idea of what you want to do, feel free.

2. Produce an accessible ebook, starting with plaintext, editing the text as markdown, then working iteratively with Pandoc, develop the stylesheet for the book and any images or other elements that you want. Finally, produce the EPUB and test it! Your book will need a cover, cataloguing metadata, and a download page.

2. Working with your edited text as script, produce and record an audiobook version of (at least 1 chapter) of your book. Your audiobook will need metadata, a download page, and a sales plan????
