## Formatting

Back to text for publishing... the XML only tells us is what is *in* the text -- its structures and parts -- but we can use those structures as hooks for formatting rules.

A **stylesheet** defines formatting rules for named structures in the text. This works in Microsoft Word, in Adobe InDesign, in your web page, and in XML more generally. 

We define rules that say things like: body copy should be 10pt Garamond on 14pt line spacing, with a 56 em line length. First-level heads should be 18pt Gill Sans -- unless they appear in the context of a sidebar, in which case it should be 12pt instead. 

A stylesheet like this produces a "templated" design -- as opposed to being hand-crafted or bespoke. The power of a templated design is that the same stylesheet can be applied to many documents. It also means that one stylesheet can be swapped for another -- changing the formatting of a document without changing the text itself. Such an approach may be useful in the context of accessibility, or in multi-mode delivery.

This formal separation of the text (and its named structures) and the formatting rules is one example of the concept of "separation of concerns," which is a more general design pattern. We have had separation of concerns in publishing since Gutenberg put moveable type into practice, and the abstract idea of a text -- in the form of a **marked up** manuscript that compositors would use in typesetting -- came to drive formatting. 

This separation of the *platonic* ideal of the text from any particular printed instance of it has both delighted and vexed scholars and critics ever since. At this very point, when the text becomes *abstract and mutable*, it also becomes capable of *fixity and durability* over centuries owing to its production and distribution in mass quantities.

Ironically, the Desktop Publishing tradition, embodied today in InDesign, runs completely counter to this idea... in InDesign, format *is* structure, not the other way around.
